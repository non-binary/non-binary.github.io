title: Built using Jekyll and SCSS
---

Hello world! 

This blog is where I want to share my thought process behind projects as well as what I learn along the way while working on them. For my first post, I'll briefly go into why I chose this set of tools.

I've been contributing to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) sites my entire career but mostly writing content for it instead of working on the website itself. I've worked with sites that were the internal company knowledge base, product documentation, landing pages, and blogs.

I decided to use Jekyll over other static generators because it's the one I have most experience with and is one of the most popular/mainstream static site generators in the community. I chose to use [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) instead of vanilla CSS because it is accepted industry-wide as an improvement.

Next steps...

I am going to implement some improvements such as pagination for blog posts, making the SCSS responsive (mobile, tablet, etc), and set up the www subdomain.
